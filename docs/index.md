# Yosemite

### The Natural Park of **easy-to-use** Python Tools for **Data Science** & **Generative AI**.

Yosemite is my personal open source project, that has been developed constantly since November 2023. It is a collection of Python tools for Data Science and Generative AI, that I have developed for my own use, and uploaded to PyPI for others to use.
Yosemite has come in quite a **LOT** a few shapes and sizes, so just for fun I've attached them all here.

Currently the package is capable of:

- CLI Text Styling, User Inputs, Dialogs, and Progress Loaders.
- A 'Unified' Elastic & Vector Search Engine & Database, that can be used locally like a function rather than a chunky service.
- Simpler LLM API Calls (currently supports Anthropic, OpenAI (w/ Instructor), Huggingface & NVIDIA APIs)
- Simpler Text Transformations (sentence-transformers & spacy)

The next page explains how to get started using Yosemite.
