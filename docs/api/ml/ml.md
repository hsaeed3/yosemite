# Yosemite - ML

Yosemite ML is **much, much** heavier than the base library, so it is obtainable as an extension. It is not included in the base library to keep the base library lightweight.

## Installation

To install the ML extension, use the following command:

```bash
pip install yosemite[ml]
```
